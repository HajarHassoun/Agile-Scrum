     <h1>Agile = Scrum?</h1> 
     <h3>What are they all about?</h3>
     <p>Agile is a set of values and principles, a mindset, whereas scrum is a framework that is heuristic (based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors).</p>

     <p>Scrum is often referred to as an agile project management framework. It is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements.</p>
    <h3>It takes a lot more to change the way that you think than it does to change the way that you work</h3>

    <h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
    <p>Scrum has 3 Artifacts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product backlog</li>
      <li>Sprint backlog</li>
      <li>Increment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are three constants that you will continue to revisit and invest in over time</p>
    <h2>Sprints</h2>
    <p>A sprint is a specific short period of time when a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. They break down big,complex projects into bite-sized pieces</p>
