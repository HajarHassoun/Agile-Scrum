      <h3>What are they all about?</h3>
     <p>Agile is a set of values and principles, a mindset, whereas scrum is a framework that is heuristic (based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors).</p>
     <p>Scrum is often referred to as an agile project management framework. It is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements.</p>

    <h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
    <p>Scrum has 3 Artifacts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product backlog</li>
      <li>Sprint backlog</li>
      <li>Increment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are three constants that you will continue to revisit and invest in over time.
       The<i>Product Backlog</i>is a dynamic list of features, requirements, enhancements, 
       and fixes that acts as the input for the sprint backlog. The product backlog is constantly 
       revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the <b>Product Owner</b>.
    </p>
    <p>The<i>Sprint Backlog</i>is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the 
       development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle.A sprint backlog may be 
       flexible and can evolve during a sprint. However, the fundamental sprint goal – what the 
       team wants to achieve from the current sprint – cannot be compromised.
    </p>
    <p>The<i>Increment</i>is the usable end-product from a sprint. it’s often referred to as the 
       team’s definition of “Done”, a milestone, the sprint goal, or even a full version or a shipped epic. 
    </p>
    <h2><b>Sprints</b></h2>
    <p>A sprint is a specific short period of time when a Scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. 
       They break down big,complex projects into bite-sized pieces.
       Sprints make projects more manageable, allow teams to ship high-quality work faster and more frequently, 
       and gives them more flexibility to adapt to change.
       Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live 
       the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan." The scrum values of transparency, inspection, 
       and adaptation are complementary to agile and central to the concept of sprints.
    <h2><b>Scrum Ceremonies/Events</b></h2>
    <p>Below is a list of all the key ceremonies a scrum team might partake in:
      <ol>
        <li>Organize the backlog</li>
        <li>Sprint planning</li>
        <li>Sprint</li>
        <li>Daily Scrum or Stand Up</li>
        <li>Sprint review</li>
        <li>Sprint retrospective</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
